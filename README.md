# reason-server

### Starting ReasonML compile

`npm start`

### Starting server

`npm run server:dev` - runs server in nodemon to automatically restart on file changes

`npm run server:start` - runs server without that

### Notes

Installing dependencies with yarn seems to do weird stuff so advise sticking to npm
